# Build Issue Resolution Guide

## Current Problem
The build is failing due to a locked `R.jar` file in the build intermediates directory:
```
C:\Users\James\Desktop\Jellyfin-New\app\build\intermediates\compile_and_runtime_not_namespaced_r_class_jar\debug\processDebugResources\R.jar
```

This file is being held by another process and cannot be deleted, preventing clean builds.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. System Restart (Recommended)
The most reliable solution is to restart your Windows machine, which will release all file locks.

### 2. Alternative Build Approaches
If restart isn't possible, try these approaches:

#### Option A: Use a Different Terminal
```powershell
# Open a new PowerShell terminal as Administrator
cd "c:\Users\James\Desktop\Jellyfin-New"
./gradlew --stop
Remove-Item "app\build" -Recurse -Force
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### Option B: Use Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open the project folder `c:\Users\James\Desktop\Jellyfin-New`
3. Go to Build > Clean Project
4. Then Build > Rebuild Project

#### Option C: Use Handle Tool (if available)
```powershell
# If you have Windows Sysinternals Handle tool
handle.exe R.jar
# Then kill the process holding the file
```

### 3. Manual File Unlock
Try using Windows Resource Monitor:
1. Open Task Manager
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Click "Open Resource Monitor"
4. Go to CPU tab
5. Search for "R.jar" in Associated Handles
6. End the process holding the file

## Image Loading Fixes Status

### âœ… Completed Fixes
1. **RobustAsyncImage.kt** - Fixed unused parameters, enhanced error handling
2. **MediaRepository.kt** - Fixed CancellationException handling for proper coroutine behavior
3. **ImageUrlHelper.kt** - Enhanced with fallback logic and comprehensive logging
4. **ImageDebugHelper.kt** - Created debugging utility for image issues
5. **HomeViewModel.kt** - Added debug methods for troubleshooting

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing
Once the build issue is resolved, the following should be tested:

#### Library Photos Loading
- Navigate to Home screen
- Check if library cards show images instead of "Failed to load" placeholders
- Verify that fallback images work when primary images are missing

#### CancellationException Fixes
- Navigate between screens quickly
- Monitor logcat for CancellationException errors
- Verify that cancellation errors are not logged as errors anymore

#### Debug Features
Call these methods in HomeViewModel for debugging:
```kotlin
viewModel.debugAllImageUrls()              // Analyze all images
viewModel.debugRecentlyAddedEpisodes()     // Focus on episode issues  
viewModel.testServerConnectivity()         // Test server connection
viewModel.debugSpecificItem(itemId)       // Debug specific item
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before
- Library cards showing "Failed to load" with generic retry buttons
- CancellationException errors flooding logcat during navigation
- Recently added TV episodes not displaying thumbnails
- No specific error information for troubleshooting

### After
- Proper fallback images when primary images aren't available
- No CancellationException errors in logcat during normal navigation transitions
- Better episode thumbnail handling with fallbacks
- Contextual error messages (Auth Error, Not Found, etc.)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging image issues

## Next Steps
1. Resolve the build file lock issue (restart recommended)
2. Build and install the app: `./gradlew installDebug`
3. Test image loading on home screen
4. Monitor logcat for CancellationException improvements
5. Use debug methods if issues persist

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jellyfinnew/ui/components/RobustAsyncImage.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jellyfinnew/data/repositories/MediaRepository.kt`

Both files are ready and the fixes should resolve the original issues once the app can be built and tested.
